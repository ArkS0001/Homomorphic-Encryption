# Homomorphic-Encryption
Imagine a technology that allows dealerships and financial institutions to process and analyze data without ever exposing it in its raw form. homomorphic encryption makes this possible by using advanced mathematical algorithms that perform computations directly on encrypted data.


Homomorphic encryption is a groundbreaking cryptographic method that allows computations to be performed directly on encrypted data without needing to decrypt it first. This means you can, for example, add or multiply numbers in their encrypted form—and when you decrypt the result, it’s exactly as if you’d performed the operations on the original data.
Key Points

    Preservation of Data Privacy: Since data remains encrypted throughout processing, sensitive information is never exposed, making it ideal for cloud computing and multi-party computations.

    Types of Homomorphic Encryption:

        Partially Homomorphic Encryption (PHE): Supports only one type of operation (like RSA for multiplication or Paillier for addition).

        Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SHE): Allows a limited number of both addition and multiplication operations.

        Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE): Supports arbitrary computations (both addition and multiplication) on encrypted data, enabling any function to be computed without ever decrypting the data.

    Historical Milestones:

        The concept dates back to proposals by Rivest, Adleman, and Dertouzos in 1978.

        In 2009, Craig Gentry introduced the first FHE scheme based on ideal lattices, which was a pivotal breakthrough in the field.

    Applications:

        Cloud Computing: Securely process data on remote servers without exposing plaintext data.

        Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning: Train and run models on encrypted datasets.

        Secure Voting Systems: Tally votes without revealing individual ballots.

Homomorphic encryption continues to evolve, with research aimed at improving its efficiency and practicality for real-world applications.
